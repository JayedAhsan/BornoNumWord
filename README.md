# BornoNumWord

## Introduction
`BornoNumWord` is a simple C++ program designed to convert numerical values into their equivalent word representations in Bangla for numbers. This utility can be particularly useful in contexts where numerical values need to be presented in a more readable or localized format, such as in financial applications, educational tools, or user interfaces tailored for Bengali-speaking users. Currently it is being used in "Borno Phonetic".

## Requirements
- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC or Clang) capable of compiling C++ code.
- Access to the standard C++ library.

## Installation
To compile the `BornoNumWord.cpp` file, you can use the following command in a terminal:

```bash
g++ -o BornoNumWord BornoNumWord.cpp
